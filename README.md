# Password Strength Analyzer

## Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly cybersecurity web application that analyzes password strength and explains why weak passwords create security risks.

## Why I Built This
I built this project to better understand authentication security and how attackers exploit weak passwords using brute-force and dictionary attacks.

## Key Security Concepts
- Brute-force attacks
- Dictionary attacks
- Password entropy
- User authentication security

## How the Application Works
- The user enters a password
- The system checks length, character variety, and common patterns
- The app displays a strength rating, explanation, and estimated crack time

## Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Lovable.ai (AI-assisted development)

## What I Learned
- Why password length is critical for security
- How attackers estimate password crack times
- The importance of educating users about secure password practices
